# BinaryTweet.com

Folks used to write books.  Then Articles.  Then Blog Posts.  Then Tweets.  Then Binary Tweets.  It can't get any smaller than this.

## I only know javascript, can I still help develop this?

_Yes._ BinaryTweet is written entirely in Javascript thanks to the [Jack](http://github.com/JackDanger/jack/) project which is just a thin wrapper around [Rack](http://rack.rubyforge.com) and [Johnson](http://github.com/jbarnette/johnson/).

Here's what you do: hit the "fork" button up above and then mess with the code.  Change it however you like - this isn't exactly NASA software.  Since it's all Javascript you can go ahead and have yourself a ball.

## What features do you have planned?

* Well, we'd like to have some code.  If there's code next to the README then please update the README for me.
* We want this to run under mod_rack/Passenger
* Tests.  Helluvalot of tests.  Write some in Javscript!
* Use the twitter api to read the @binarial account for folks sending updates to it.

## Uh, why would you build this?

Pshaw!  I haven't yet!  Note: if I've built this please update the README.
