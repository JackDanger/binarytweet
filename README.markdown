# BinaryTweet.com

Folks used to write books.  Then Articles.  Then Blog Posts.  Then Tweets.  Then Binary Tweets.  It can't get any smaller than this.

## I only know javascript, can I still help develop this?

_Yes._ BinaryTweet is written entirely in Javascript thanks to the [Jack](http://github.com/JackDanger/jack/) project which is just a thin wrapper around [Rack](http://rack.rubyforge.com) and [Johnson](http://github.com/jbarnette/johnson/).

Here's what you do: hit the "fork" button up above and then mess with the code.  Change it however you like - this isn't exactly NASA software.  Since it's all Javascript you can go ahead and have yourself a ball.

## What features do you have planned?

You want features?  Really? Why are you even reading this README?
Okay, here's how it'll work: you twitter like so:

	@binarial 0
	
Or, (wait for it...)

	@binarial 1

And that becomes part of your "binary tweetscape".
Or "digital twitterstream".
Or "time you'll never get back"

## Uh, why would you build this?

Coding is fun. We have to remember that.
